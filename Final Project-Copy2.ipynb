    "Throughout this course, we have progressed with more and more advanced models for Recommender Systems. In this final step, we propose a complete Recommender System, that takes advantage of an large and vast dataset in order conduct an in depth investigation into the ideas that we have explored over the course of the last 7 weeks. Unlike the other projects that focused specifically on implement small recommender systems, our project here focuses on optimization of several ideas in order to implement a complete Recommender system, that takes time costs, and processing speed into consideration. Again our data is targeted torwards the movie genre (as again the dataset is readily available), but here we propose a more broad scope of techniques to minimize processing speed and optimize accuracy. As we move forward with technology, our amount of data continues to exponential grow, and the best way to process this vast source of data. Our target audience here would be any data host, with a continually growing data source, as we would like to be able to create a continually adaptable recommender system that does not require an epic amount of processing time. The way we propose to do this is to utilize the idea of Decoupling "

For the movie and User content matrices, each row will represent an movie or user, respectively, while the columns will represent a specific aspect of the movie or user. For istances, all the movie break downs will be either 0 or 1, indicating if it belongs to a specific genre (19 in total). For the users, each column will represnt a specific age range the belong to, their gender, and their occupation. \n",

The idea here is that we can \"fill\" in the larger sparse data with a subset chosen based on age. This in theory would weight the factorization, and skew it heavily on the side of the age range picked (the thought here being that you would complete each ALS factorization for all the age ranges). As SVD tends to produce values that \"overfit\" producing values that meet the factorization, but do are not viable, the other factorization process are preferred.    \n",
    "    * The idea her would be to create multiple iterations, \"randomly\" splitting the dataset as a whole, completing the subset matrices, and then combining the subsets into the whole. After each iteration, we would then calculate the RMSE, and then repeat the process. Theoretically, after each step, the RMSE would decrease (if it is indeed the case)[5]. (I am attempting to obtain the publication for Barjasteh et. al [5]. At the moment I'd have to purchase it, but I signed up for free version through requests). From the video, there was some doubts on whether or not these results were accurate. Though they utilize a much more complex system, then the one I propose, if their stipulation that one can complete thest small subsets (that meet certain rank requirements) at random and produce accurate results. For our purposes here, due to the inability to get the AWS Sparks running, we are changing the \"Randomly\" selected datasets, and replacing them with specific contextual based subsets. First, each age range was extracted, with the understanding that people of different age groups will rate differently, based on personal preference. Using SVD, each of these individual subsets were then factored down and reproduced using a smaller feature set (k= 50 this number was chosen based on previous projects). Furthermore, we took several genre examples as well. I chose the 7 genres that I felt most distinctly represented the group as a whole: action, children's, comedy, drama, horror, romance, and sci-fi.One cause for concern however, was that each "
